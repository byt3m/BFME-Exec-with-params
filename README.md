Made it so I can run BFME with parameters when using gameranger. This way I can load HD texture pack and any other mod that requires command line to be ran.

Current version: 2.0.0.2

How to install:
1. Go to the game's installation directory and rename the original game file "lotrbfme.exe" to "lotrbfme_.exe".
1. Extract BFME-Exec-with-params files to game's installation directory.
1. Edit the variable called "execution_parameters" contained in file "lotrbfme_parameters.ini" to use the parameters you want.
1. Run the game.
